# 🌾 Predictive Modeling for Agriculture  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores **predictive modeling** in agriculture to identify the **most important feature** for classifying crop types.  

Using a dataset of crop features, we aim to:  
1. Determine which single feature has the **strongest predictive performance** for predicting the crop type.  
2. Store the result in a variable for further analysis.

## 📑 Task Requirements  

### Best Predictive Feature  
- Identify the feature that produces the **highest predictive score** for classifying `crop`.  
- Save the result in a variable called `best_predictive_feature`  
- `best_predictive_feature` should be a **dictionary**:  
  ```python
  { "feature_name": score }
feature_name → the name of the most predictive feature
score → evaluation score for your chosen metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score)
